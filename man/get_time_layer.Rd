\title{Add time series layers}
\usage{
get_time_layer(layer, from, to)
}
\arguments{
\item{layer}{type of data to be added ("temperature" for monthly mean temperature in Â°C or "rainfall" for sum of monthly rainfall in mm). Climatic data layers (temperature and rainfall) are available from 2000 to 2020.}

\item{from}{starting year (from 2000 to 2020)}

\item{to}{ending year (may be the same as starting year to extract only one year of data)}

a tibble with the hexagon number ("hex_id" column) and the selected features values
}
\description{
Add time series data layer, based on the spatial grid of the map obtained by the get_map() function
